# Project4
This is the first project for me using Power BI. Here, I made some calculations for revenue using some built-in functions in Power bi 
to determine the change happening in revenue . 
Also, I used the power query editor to adjust some columns in the data and make some steps to clean our data to be prepared for analysis.
